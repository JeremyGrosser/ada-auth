@LabeledSection{Changes for ACATS 4.0}

Version 4.0 of the ACATS updates version 3.1 with additional tests for
features defined in @LocalLink{Target=[Ada2012],Sec=[References],Text={[Ada2012]}}.
It includes more than 110 new tests to check features including
Ada.Containers, aspect specification notation, conditional expressions,
pre- and postconditions, subtype predicates, new iterator forms,
user-defined references and indexing, and formal incomplete types.

In addition, 35 additional tests were corrected or removed in to reflect
changes in Ada reflected by @LocalLink{Target=[Ada2012],Sec=[References],Text={[Ada2012]}},
as well as in response to
test disputes and ARG issue resolutions.

See @RefSec{Version Description} for lists of added, deleted and modified
tests.
