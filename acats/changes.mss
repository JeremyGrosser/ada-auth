@LabeledSection{Changes for ACATS 3.0}

Version 3.0 of the ACATS is the first version to test the changes brought
to Ada by
@LocalLink{Target=[Amend1],Sec=[References],Text={[Amend1]}}. It includes
nearly 80 new tests to check features including interface types,
@key[limited with] clauses, overriding indicators, <> in aggregates, and
expanded use of limited types.

In addition, many tests that were incompatible with
@LocalLink{Target=[Amend1],Sec=[References],Text={[Amend1]}}
were modified or removed.

Finally, a few tests that contained errors have been modified.

See @RefSec{Version Description} for lists of added, deleted and modified
tests.
