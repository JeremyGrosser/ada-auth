ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the
International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for
worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC
participate in the development of International Standards through technical
committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular
fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in
fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work.

In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint
technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. Draft International Standards adopted by
the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting.
Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of
the national bodies casting a vote.

International Standard ISO/IEC 15291 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee
ISO/IEC JTC 1, @i{Information technology}, Subcommittee 22, @i{Programming
languages, their environments and system software interfaces}.

Annexes A, B, C, @Chg{Version=[2],New=[D, and E],Old=[and D]} of
this International Standard are for information only.
